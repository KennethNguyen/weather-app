# Weather-app

## Description

A weather app created using React and uses [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get data for the current weather around the world

My first exposure of using an API and learning more about React version 16.0+ (particularly arrow functions and immediate state declaration instead of creating a constructor and binding methods) 

Inspired by [Hamza Mirza's React Weather App Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204C9yNeOYI)

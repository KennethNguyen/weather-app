# Weather-app

## Description

A weather app created using React and uses OpenWeatherMap API to get data for the current weather around the world

My first exposure of using an API and learning more about React version 16.0+ (particularly arrow functions and immediate state declaration instead of creating a constructor and binding methods) 

## Utilized
* Framework: React
* API: OpenWeatherMap API
* HTML | Javascript | CSS

## Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/KennethNguyen/weather-app`
* `cd weather-app && npm install`
